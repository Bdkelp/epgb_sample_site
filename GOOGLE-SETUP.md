## 4. Optional: Add Direct Review Button to Contact Widget

Want to add a review button to your floating contact widget?

Add this inside `<div class="contact-quick-actions">` in `index.html`:

```html
<button class="contact-action" onclick="window.open('https://search.google.com/local/writereview?placeid=YOUR_PLACE_ID', '_blank')">
    <svg width="24" height="24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
        <path d="M12 2l3.09 6.26L22 9.27l-5 4.87 1.18 6.88L12 17.77l-6.18 3.25L7 14.14 2 9.27l6.91-1.01L12 2z"/>
    </svg>
    <span>Review Us</span>
</button>
```

```javascript
"aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "5.0",
    "reviewCount": "150"

```

**Update if needed:**
